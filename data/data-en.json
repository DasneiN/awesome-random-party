In this period, residential projects in the style of constructivism were built on the projects of S. Shabunevsky. One of the first multi-storey buildings in Gomel was a house on ul. Pushkin, 26, who had a section type apartment (1927). This building with cut corners of the facades received the name round gray house from Gomel residents. Broken glass was added to the plaster of its exterior walls. The sparkling hues that it creates, at the project designers, should somehow facilitate the appearance of this gray monolith. The six-storied dwelling house for workers of a steam locomotive car-repair plant with communal apartments - House-Commune (1929—1931, Lenin Ave., 51) became the highest building of the pre-war city. Long corridors with a large number of apartments and communal kitchens corresponded to the then ideas that in a communist society everyone should live together as a commune. In addition, such houses could accommodate a significant number of people who needed housing. With the features of constructivism, but already with separate apartments, S. Shabunevsky built in the early 1930s a house on Lenin Ave. 31, which consists of a central volume and two side wings, forming a cozy inner estate."
